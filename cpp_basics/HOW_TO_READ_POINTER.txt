Read it backwards (as driven by Clockwise/Spiral Rule):

int* - pointer to int
int const * - pointer to const int
int * const - const pointer to int
int const * const - const pointer to const int

Now the first const can be on either side of the type so:

const int * == int const *
const int * const == int const * const
If you want to go really crazy you can do things like this:

int ** - pointer to pointer to int
int ** const - a const pointer to a pointer to an int
int * const * - a pointer to a const pointer to an int
int const ** - a pointer to a pointer to a const int
int * const * const - a const pointer to a const pointer to an int
